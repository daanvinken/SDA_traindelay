## Research questions
Can we correctly predict train delays using historical data?

## Dataset
Our dataset consists of departure times of trains, containing info like:
departure time (timestamp), station (location) and delay (difference between planned and actual departure time) and more, like trainnumber, whether it was cancelled or not etc.

The daterange of this data is that of the entire past year.

## Time planning
Week 1:
Gather data. Current source is treinposities.nl (https://treinposities.nl/vertrekstaat), and possibly from NS (https://apiportal.ns.nl/).
Familiarize and vizualise the data, to see if we can find possible probable hypotheses.

Week 2:
Formulize hypotheses, start testing hypotheses.

Week 3:
Further testing of hypotheses, if possible implement nice-to-have's, such as using additional data sources, for example weather data.

Week 4:
Finish implementing tests and nice-to-haves, make presentation.
